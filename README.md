The application that I created is a pygame. Within it you will start on the start screen where it will give you simple instructions on how to play the game. From there you need to press any key which will start the game for you. The object of the game is to collect the green icons while avoiding the red ones. You may use the left and right keys to move side to side or the up key to move upwards. There is gravity on your character so if you are not moving up you will start to fall. This game I needed to use multiple classes to make each piece, and within each class there are multiple functions. In my game I use a dictionary of lists with comments that will show on the game over screen based on how well you did in the game. I ended up using pygame, random, and clock in my coding to get the game to work correctly. The game also will create a text file where it will send your high score and it will let you know what the high score is on the game over screen and if you beat it. To get the high score drawn from the file without breaking at some points I used a try, except setup to send the game a zero if there was no file already created.

	I ended up not getting the game that I was initially planning for when I started this project. I had originally planned the character to stay relatively low on the screen and only be able to jump about twice its height. As I was making the game, I found it to be repetitive and not all that interesting, so I ended up tweaking it until I got what I have now. I thoroughly enjoyed this project because it reminded me of a competition, I use to go to in high school that used a simplified software to design games. I had a good time trying out different ideas to see what would work. On the other hand, it got very frustrating at times when I could envision what I wanted the coding to do but for some reason just could not get it to work. For the most part though I believe that this project helped to solidify my understanding of python and coding in general.
